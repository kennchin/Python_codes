# python_cross_validation
Example of using K-fold cross validation to check performance of the classifier.
  - the basic idea is to split the dataset into "K" subsets and then use one of the subset as a test set and the rest as the training set.
  - We repeat the steps above "K" many times and each time using a different test set.
  - At the end, we average the accuracy of each "K" subsets.
