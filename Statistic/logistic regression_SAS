WHEN USING THE NATIVE SAS PROGRAM FROM YOUR PC

Let’s open a menu based interface in SAS for data analysis:

proc insight data=AD;
run;

To perform logistic regression analysis,

1.	Click on the Analyze menu and select Fit(Y X).

2.	Select variable y in the left column and then click the y button towards the right. Do the same for x.


3.	Click on the Method button at the bottom of the display, and select a Binomial Response Distribution with a Logit Link Function. Click OK.

4.	You are now back to the main Fit menu. Click OK, and the model analysis will appear.


FOR LATER:
One result of this analysis is to produce residuals (R_y) and fitted values (P_y) into the AD data set. 

Now to plot the fitted values versus the regressors, 

1.	Click on the Analyze menu and select Scatter Plot (Y X).
2.	Select variable P_y in the left column and then click the y button towards the right. Do the same for x.
3.	Click OK, and the graph will appear.


WHEN USING THE SAS STUDIO ONLINE

For the AD data, we can use the following code:

proc logistic data=AD plots=all;
	model y(event='1')=x / link=logit technique=fisher;
	output out=WORK.Logistic_stats xbeta=xbeta_ predicted=pred_;
run;

where (event=’1’) indicates the “success” variable

output out=WORK.Logistic_stats creates an output file with the original data and the newly created variables as follows:

xbeta=xbeta_ provides the estimates from a least squares model

predicted=pred_ provides the probabilities P(Y=1|xi)
